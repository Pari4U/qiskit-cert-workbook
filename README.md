# qiskit-cert-workbook

Here is the workbook I created while preparing for the Qiskit Certification exam. I followed the official [guide](https://slides.com/javafxpert/prep-qiskit-dev-cert-exam) by James Weaver and tried to cover most of the topics which come up in the exam. I decided to leave out the explanation of basic concepts in Qiskit as they are best described in the first two chapters of Qiskit [Textbook](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html). At the same time I have put more attention into rather advanced concepts which were new for me.

I'll be glad if you find this workbook useful. Once you go through it, I suggest you make a texbook of your own on the same manner. What is a better way to learn something, than to explain it to someone? :)

Certainly take a look at the official study [guide](https://slides.com/javafxpert/prep-qiskit-dev-cert-exam). Another amazing [workbook](https://github.com/bartubisgin/qiskit-certified-exam-workbook) was created by Bartu Bisgin and goes through slightly different topics. There is another great and extensive textbook by Dimple M. which I wish I found before I took my exam.
